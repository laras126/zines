					<p>I wrote two letters to friends in the morning. One was a friend from when I was literally a baby who I haven't <em>really</em> talked to in probably five years.</p>
					<p>I loved writing the letters, and I considered that hand-written letters really are the ultimate form of human communication. Time-tested. The perfect a cocktail of investment, anticipation, risk, and reward that make for a satisfying experience.</p>

			<section class="panel panel-3">

				<div class="text">
					<p>The letters also made me think about what lasts and what doesn't last. Paper lasts. Live jounral entries, adobe illustrator files, facebook posts, and digital photos do not last. The file I am typing into right now will not last. But this, what you are reading right now, will last because I printed as a zine on paper.</p>
					<p>But very few people would read this zine if it was only available on paper and why do anything ever if no one is going to read it.</p>

					<p>I write better when I write by hand. I am typing right now – not writing by hand. Typing is too fast and its too easy to be perfect. There's no time to think, but there's endless time to refine. The ideas don't have time to live at all before they become trapped in words. They move too fast from a brain to a screen, and then I try to make them perfect even though the ideas are just babies.</p>

					<p>I stole this idea from Ocean Vong who wrote a really amazing book that I read. I looked at his instagram and he had a Q&A story about the book and said that it took him 8 years to write, had 12 drafts, and was first written by hand. He recommends that all writers write first by hand, because the sentence needs time to breath.</p>

					<p>I am a writer. I mean, I'm not <em>really</em> a writer, but I am a writer. These sentences right here that you are reading didn't have time to breathe. I told you already – they are babies. Fresh from the womb, over-edited, and now will remain that way because they are already out of my brain and into a final form. They will be babies forever. Sucks.</div>

				<div class="text">
					<p>I was in such a hurry to make a website-app-tool-thing so I could create more zines more quickly using the computer, but I didn't realize all the sentences I wrote in the website-app-tool-thing would remain babies forever. I guess the irony is that I'm liking how this zine of baby sentences is coming together right now. Maybe some ideas don't need to grow up. Or maybe this is part of them growing up.</p>

					<p>Anyway, I felt satisfied on 4/18/20. And now it's 4/19/20 and I also feel satisfied, but I do feel a little lonely.</p>
