					<p>Sleep has not been a friend to me for the past three nights. Not just one night, <em>three</em> nights in a row. The night after the first night, its like, "Well, I am so tired, I will definitely sleep tonight."</p>
					<p>And then I lay down to sleep and something happens and I'm like, "What if it happens again...no it wouldn't, I'm so tired...".</p>
					<p>And then it happens again.</p>

					<p>And then the next night, after two nights of terrible sleep, it's like, "Wow, I am so, <em>so</em> tired, I will definitely sleep tonight."</p>
					<p>And then I lay down to sleep and something happens and I think, "No, it couldn't happen again, could it? Not <em>3</em> nights in a row...I am so tired..." and then my chest feels tight and I think "Oh my god, it's happening again" and then I feel really hot, not sweaty, just hot, and like my eyes are open even though they are closed.</p>

					<p>I try to count my breaths and control my thoughts. Work thoughts and sex thoughts keep creeping in, and I try to use the meditation tactics and turn my focus back to counting. Then I feel thirsty. I drink some water and roll back onto the "getting ready to fall asleep" side. Then I roll over to the "ready fall asleep" side and I feel hungry.</p>
					<p>I try counting my breaths again, then I think, "whatever, if I'm going to be laying here for hours I'm going to think about what I want to think about." Which is sex. Then I feel turned on and even more awake. Then I feel angry and think, "FUCK THIS SHIT WHY THE FUCK IS THIS HAPPENENING". I'm frustrated. I don't understand it.</p>

					<p>I know I will survive – I've given a conference talk on zero hours of sleep before – and it's not impossible that the day might even be a good day - but it also might be the worst day. I had fun plans for tomorrow, and now they are ruined because I will be a shell of my normal self. I wanted to go for a long run and have a wonderful, restful weekend day, but it's all been ruined by this fucking sleep shit. And I feel really sad and I mourn the wonderful, restful weekend I will not have.</p>

					<p>After two to three cycles of this, interrupted by bathroom breaks and going to the other room to write in my jounral, I fall asleep. Then I wake up at 7am and think, "fuck this shit". I doze off for an hour or so. Then I wake up and just lay there. Feeling like I did when I went to sleep.</p>
